:star: An application designed to simulate epidemic processes on networks, leveraging the versatility of `Python` as the primary tool, and `Fortran` for handling more computationally intensive calculations.

## Introduction
In June 2023, I successfully completed my undergraduate thesis as an aspiring physicist. The aim of this project is to expand upon and refine the work I developed over the course of approximately four months.

* You can find the paper I wrote about the thesis on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnau-perez-perez/) profile.

## How to run the app?
Unfortunately, I'm currently working on the app `backend` so there is no user interface to interact with the app :pensive:. 

However, to see the process of the backend, I strongly recomend to use the `FastAPI docs` tool to interact with the backend more visually :star_struck:.

## 🔍 Features
### CRUD
At the moment, the app backend is only capable of `creating` & `reading` & `updating` & `deleting` networks.

## :star: Goal
Build an app to simulate and study disease spreading processes in networks, with the aim of investigating possible strategies to combat or limit the spread of diseases.
