## Introduction
In June 2023, I successfully completed my undergraduate thesis as an aspiring physicist. The aim of this project is to expand upon and refine the work I developed over the course of approximately four months.

* The paper I wrote about the thesis is abailable in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnau-perez-perez/){:target="_blank"} profile.

## How to run the app?
Unfortunately, I'm currently working on the app `backend` so there is no user interface to interact with the app :pensive:. 

However, to see the progress of the backend, I strongly recomend to use the `FastAPI docs` tool to interact with the backend more visually :star_struck:.

## Features
### ðŸ”„ CRUD
At the moment, the app backend is only capable of `creating` & `reading` & `updating` & `deleting` networks.

## Goal
:star: Build an app to simulate and study disease spreading processes in networks, with the aim of investigating possible strategies to combat or limit the spread of diseases.
