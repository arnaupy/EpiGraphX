:star: An application designed to simulate epidemic processes on networks, leveraging the versatility of `Python` as the primary tool, and `C++` for handling more computationally intensive calculations.

Documentation -> https://arnaupy.github.io/EpiGraphX/

---

## Introduction
In June 2023, I successfully completed my undergraduate thesis as an aspiring physicist. The aim of this project is to expand upon and refine the work I developed over the course of approximately four months.

- You can find the paper I wrote about the thesis on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnau-perez-perez/) profile.

## How to run the app?
Unfortunately, I'm currently working on the app `backend` so there is no user interface to interact with the app :pensive:. 

However, `FastAPI` creates automatically the api documentation using `redocs` or `docs` :star_struck:.

## Features
At the moment, the app backend is capable of:

- CRUD Networks -> `create` & `read` & `update` & `delete` networks.
- CRUD Files -> `create` & `read` & `delete` (network) files.


## Quick start

## Contributing

## Goal
‚≠ê Build an app to simulate and study disease spreading processes in networks, with the aim of investigating possible strategies to combat or limit the spread of diseases.
