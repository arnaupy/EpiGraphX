:star: App to simulate Epidemics on Networks.

Documentation -> https://arnaupy.github.io/EpiGraphX/

---

## Introduction
In June 2023, I successfully completed my undergraduate thesis as an aspiring physicist. The aim of this project is to expand upon and refine the work I developed over the course of approximately four months.

* You can find the paper I wrote about the thesis on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnau-perez-perez/) profile.
  
See -> [How to interact with the backend?](./docs/dev-guide/InteractBackend/InteractBackend.md)

## How to run the app?
Unfortunately, I'm currently working on the app `backend` so there is no user interface to interact with the app :pensive:. 

However, to see the process of the backend, I strongly recomend to use the `FastAPI docs` tool to interact with the backend more visually :star_struck:.

## Features
### CRUD
At the moment, the app backend is only capable of `creating` & `reading` & `updating` & `deleting` networks. 

See -> [How is CRUD implemented in the project?](./docs/dev-guide/Features/CRUD.md)

## Quick start
See -> [Quick Start](./docs/dev-guide/QuickStart/QuickStart.md) :rocket:

## Contributing

## Goal
:star: Build an app to simulate and study disease spreading processes in networks, with the aim of investigating possible strategies to combat or limit the spread of diseases.
